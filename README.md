# Periodic-Table-Game

This game was our first project from the "Foundations" independent study phase of Fullstack Academy's immersive program. As such, this is my first experience using HTML and CSS. I learned a great deal, especially that there is so much more to learn! 

The objective was to create a simple number guessing game. I got the basic functionality to work using Javascript's implementation of classes, higher order functions and simple CSS, but I figured it was too simple of a game for adults, so I reimagined it as a child's educational game.  Having a background in chemistry, I thought this could be a great way to help children learn about the periodic table of elements.  After baking considerations for that into the Javascript using class extensions and a new object to reference numbers to the periodic table of elements, I restyled the CSS for a child's theme using fun colors, playful text and CSS grid for positioning.  

I really enjoyed this project as it was a first step toward tying together the code, structure and style elements I have been learning separately.  I am so much looking forward to the Junior phase of Fullstack's Immersive Program!
